# F# experiments
Some experimentation with the F# language -- Functional programming HYPE


## search.fs
A simple algorithm to search through an ordered array, ranging from 10 to 100, for the number 51. It returns the position of that element on the array.

It uses both regular `for` iteration and binary search to find the position, and returns both findings (which are indeed the same).

## stillalive.fs
A simple `Console.Beep()` version of the famous hit song "Still Alive" from the "Portal" game. A recording is available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/1AxU9AArc0Q).

I actually learned how to read music sheets in the process of making this, so that's a bonus.
