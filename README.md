Some experimentation with the F# language -- Functional programming HYPE


## search.fs
A simple algorithm to search through an ordered array, ranging from 10 to 100, for the number 51. It returns the position of that element on the array.

It uses both regular `for` iteration and binary search to find the position, and returns both findings (which are indeed the same).
